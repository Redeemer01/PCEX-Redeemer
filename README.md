# PCEX-Redeemer

Welcome to the Redeemer Bot! This application automates the process of redeeming codes from a Telegram group and submitting them on the PCEX website. Follow the steps below to set up and run the bot.

## What You Need

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

1. **Telegram Account**: You need a Telegram account to use this bot.
2. **License Key**: A valid license key is required to activate the bot. Contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/Ali_Abbas_01) to get one.
3. **Google Chrome**: The bot uses Google Chrome to interact with the PCEX website. Make sure Chrome is installed on your computer.
4. **Environment File (.env)**: A file containing your API credentials and login details.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Google Chrome

Download and install Google Chrome from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### 2. Prepare the .env File

The bot requires a `.env` file to store your credentials safely. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the same folder where the `.exe` file is located.
2. Open it using any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
3. Copy and paste the following content into the file:
 ```
   API_ID=your_telegram_api_id
   API_HASH=your_telegram_api_hash
   PHONE_NUMBER=your_telegram_phone_number in this format +97312345678
   PCEX_USERNAME=your_pcex_email
   PCEX_PASSWORD=your_pcex_password
   ```

4. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:
- `your_telegram_api_id` and `your_telegram_api_hash`: Obtain these from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/apps) by creating a new app. *(Note: No need to fill the URL field.)*

### 3. Run the Redeemer Bot

- Double-click the `redeemer.exe` file to start the bot.
- When prompted, enter your **license key** and press **Enter**.
- If the license key is valid, the bot will start running.
